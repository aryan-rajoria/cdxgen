/**
 * Run the unit test suite under Bun or Deno.
 *
 * Poku spawns each test file with the runtime named by `POKU_RUNTIME`, so the
 * suite can be pointed at another runtime without changing the tests. Two
 * groups are held back:
 *
 * - Files that mock modules with esmock. Esmock hooks Node's loader chain,
 *   which neither Bun nor Deno provides, so these fail on the mocking rather
 *   than on anything cdxgen does. The set is computed rather than listed, so a
 *   new esmock test is covered without touching this file.
 * - The per-runtime lists below, each of which is a genuine gap rather than a
 *   tool limitation. They are listed individually so that the cost of the gap
 *   stays visible and shrinks as the causes are fixed.
