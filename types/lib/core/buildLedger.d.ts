/**
 * Build ledger: an opt-in, worker-safe recorder of structured build-adequacy
 * events.
 *
 * Producers record what a run did to its build environment — the tool versions
 * a project expected, the tools that were actually found, the commands that
 * failed, the fallback code paths that were taken — and the post-generation
 * reflection turns those events into a fidelity verdict. The recorder follows
 * the shape of `activity.js` but stays a separate stream: activity records
 * describe security-relevant side effects consumed by the secure-mode
 * machinery, while ledger events describe environment adequacy consumed by the
 * introspection report.
 *
 * Two facts about workers shape the design:
 *
 * 1. A worker thread gets its own instance of this module, so events recorded
 *    inside a worker are invisible to the main thread's in-memory buffer.
 *    When `CDXGEN_INTROSPECT_LEDGER` is set, every instance appends its events
 *    to the same JSONL sidecar through an `O_APPEND` descriptor (only the main
 *    thread truncates, at open), which makes the sidecar the only complete
 *    record of a multi-worker run. Consumers must therefore prefer the sidecar
 *    when it exists and fall back to `getLedgerEvents()` only when it does not.
 * 2. Every write reaches the descriptor synchronously at record time, so a
 *    lost tail is impossible; the descriptor is released when the process
 *    exits (`closeLogStreams` closes every shared writer) or earlier through
 *    {@link closeLedger}.
 *
 * Values that could carry credentials are scrubbed before they are stored or
 * written: `command`, `path` and `detail` pass through sensitive-assignment
 * redaction plus the BOM property sanitizer, so a leaked token can never reach
 * a report file that agents upload.
