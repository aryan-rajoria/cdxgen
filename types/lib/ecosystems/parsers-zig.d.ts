/**
 * Zig `build.zig.zon` parser.
 *
 * `build.zig.zon` is ZON — Zig Object Notation — and it is not JSON. It uses
 * unquoted `.field = value` syntax, `.{}` anonymous struct literals, tuples
 * (positional struct fields), multiline string literals, character literals,
 * hex/underscore-separated numbers, and enum literals (`.foo`). A naive
 * `JSON.parse` with fixups cannot read it, so this module ships a real
 * tokenizer and recursive-descent parser.
 *
 * The grammar implemented here is the subset that appears in `build.zig.zon`:
 * anonymous struct literals, tuples, string literals (with the full Zig escape
 * set), multiline string literals, numbers, character literals, booleans,
 * `null`, enum literals, and `//` line comments — ZON is Zig syntax, and the
 * manifest `zig init` generates is largely comments.

/**
 * Parse a Zig `build.zig.zon` file and return a package list and parent
 * component describing the project and its dependencies.
 *
 * Zig dependencies are content-addressed rather than versioned by tag, so a
 * fetched dependency's identity comes from its `.hash`. Two encodings are in
 * use: the pre-0.14 hex multihash, where a `1220` prefix denotes SHA-2-256
 * (codec `0x12`, 32-byte length `0x20`), and the 0.14+ form
 * `<name>-<version>-<base64 digest>`, which carries the dependency's declared
 * version. The multihash digest is emitted as a CycloneDX `hashes[]` entry
 * when the codec is recognised; the raw hash string is always kept as a
 * property so nothing is lost for encodings that cannot be decoded.
 *
 * `zig` is not a registered purl type, so dependencies use `pkg:generic/...`
 * with a `cdx:purl:proposedType=zig` property and a `download_url` qualifier
 * built from the `url`.
 *
 * @param {string} zonFile Path to `build.zig.zon`
