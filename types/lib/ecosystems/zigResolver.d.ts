/**
 * Zig transitive dependency resolver.
 *
 * Zig has no central registry. A dependency is a content-addressed archive
 * whose identity is its `.hash`. The same hash string is used as a filesystem
 * lookup key across every Zig version — only the container differs (in-tree
 * `zig-pkg/` directory, extracted cache directory, or cache `.tar.gz`
 * archive). This module walks the full dependency graph by locating each
 * dependency's `build.zig.zon` through those containers, then emits a flat
 * component list plus a CycloneDX `dependencies[]` edge list.
 *
 * Resolution is a pure filesystem walk keyed on hashes already present in the
 * manifests. No subprocess, no network, no toolchain. Populating the cache
 * (`zig build --fetch`) is the user's job.
 */
/**
 * Validate a Zig `.hash` string against the two known encodings before it is
 * used to build a filesystem path.
 *
 * A `.hash` is attacker-controlled data from a manifest. Joining it blindly
 * into `<cache>/p/<hash>/build.zig.zon` would let a `../` in the hash escape
 * the cache directory. The two legal encodings never contain path separators
 * or `..` segments, so any hash that does not match one of them is refused
 * before the filesystem is touched.
 *
 * The two forms are:
 *   1. 0.14+ — `<name>-<version>-<base64url digest>` where the digest uses
 *      `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`.
 *   2. Pre-0.14 — hex multihash, all hex digits (at least 4 characters).
 *
 * @param {string|undefined} hash Hash field value from the manifest
 * @returns {boolean} `true` only when the hash matches a known Zig encoding
