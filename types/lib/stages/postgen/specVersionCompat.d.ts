/**
 * CycloneDX specification version compatibility.
 *
 * A BOM assembled in memory always carries the richest shape cdxgen knows how
 * to produce. Emitting it at an older specification version therefore means
 * removing elements that version does not define, and reshaping the ones it
 * models differently — CycloneDX forbids additional properties, so a stray
 * field fails schema validation outright.
 *
 * The reshaping is not purely subtractive. `evidence.identity` is a single
 * object up to 1.5 and an array from 1.6, and `metadata.tools` flips from a
 * `tools` object to component/service arrays at 2.0, so downgrades and upgrades
 * both rewrite structure rather than just delete keys.
 *
 * This module is the single home for that logic. It is applied to generated
 * BOMs by the postgen stage and to existing BOMs by `cdx-convert --to`, so both
 * paths produce byte-identical output for the same target version.
