/**
 * Per-host rate policy for batched registry fetches.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for the JS transport's concurrency and
 * minimum-interval decisions. The numbers are shared with the Rust transport
 * (`cdxgen-plugins-bin/thirdparty/cdxrs/src/fetch/rate.rs`); a change to one
 * side must be reflected in the other, and `fetchRate.poku.js` pins them so a
 * drift is visible.
 *
 * Why a per-host table rather than a single global interval: a single-registry
 * project — which is to say, almost every npm project — has exactly one host,
 * so a conservative per-host cap *is* the global cap. Applying crates.io's
 * 250 ms to every host caps an npm run at 4 requests per second, which is
 * slower than the serial JS path once connection reuse is taken into account.
 * Hosts that publish a limit get an interval; hosts that do not are bounded by
 * the per-host concurrency cap alone, and by whatever `Retry-After` they send.
