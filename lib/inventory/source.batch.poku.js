/**
 * Batched resolution of repository URLs from purls.
 *
 * `resolveGitUrlFromPurl` takes one purl, so the batch round and the resolution
 * switch derive the registry URL from a single shared function. The risk that
 * matters is those two drifting apart — a prefetch that spelled a URL even
 * slightly differently would fetch documents nobody reads and leave the switch
 * making its own serial request, which no output assertion would catch. These
 * tests count requests to pin that down.
