/**
 * Hash a schema's *content*, independent of checkout line endings.
 *
 * Hashing the raw bytes makes this guard fail on Windows for a reason that has
 * nothing to do with drift: git checks these JSON files out with CRLF there, so
 * every hash differs (`bom-1.6.schema.json` hashes to 25dea08c… with LF and
 * b82391bf… with CRLF). Normalising first keeps the guard about what it is
 * supposed to catch — a schema diverging from its vendored copy in
 * cdxgen-plugins-bin — rather than about how the tree was checked out.
 *
 * Note the vendored side stores the same normalised digests in
 * `thirdparty/cdxrs/schemas/checksums.sha256`, so both must be regenerated
 * together when a schema legitimately changes.
