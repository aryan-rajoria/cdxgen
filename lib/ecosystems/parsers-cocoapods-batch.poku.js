/**
 * Staged batching of remote CocoaPods podspec lookups.
 *
 * The probe is speculative — up to four URLs per pod — so the property that
 * matters is not "fewer round trips" but "never more requests than the serial
 * probe made". These tests assert the request set exactly.
 *
 * They live in their own file, and inside an awaited `describe`, because one of
 * them mutates COCOA_FULL_SCAN: poku fires `it` calls as fire-and-forget
 * promises, so without both the flag would reach the other two mid-run and they
 * would observe an empty request set.
