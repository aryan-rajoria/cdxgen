/**
 * Tests for the deferred `fail-on-error` exit: an introspected run whose
 * extractor fails must still write the BOM and both reports and only then
 * exit with the dedicated failure status, while a run without introspection
 * keeps the historical contract of exiting 1 before any output exists.
 *
 * Every assertion drives `bin/cdxgen.js`, because the deferred exit is
 * decided after `postProcess` — a test on `createBom` would never reach the
 * code under test. The file therefore spawns the node CLI directly.
