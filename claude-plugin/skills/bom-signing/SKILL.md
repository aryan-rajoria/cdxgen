description: Signs and verifies CycloneDX BOMs using cdxgen's native JSON Signature Format (JSF) implementation via cdx-sign and cdx-verify, supporting granular component, service, and annotation signatures, parallel multi-signatures, and sequential signature chains. Use when asked to sign an SBOM, verify a BOM signature, establish BOM authenticity or non-repudiation, build an approval trail across pipeline stages, or generate signing keys.

# Sign and verify BOMs

cdxgen ships a native JSON Signature Format (JSF) implementation that goes
beyond a single document-level signature. It supports granular signatures over
individual components, services, and annotations; parallel multi-signatures via
`signers`; and sequential signature chains via `chain`.

Read [reference/safety.md](../../reference/safety.md) first.

## Key handling boundary

**Never generate, read, paste, or transcribe private key material yourself, and
never enter a passphrase on the user's behalf.** Run the signing commands with
paths the user provides, and if a key does not exist yet, give the user the
command to create it and let them run it.

For a throwaway demo or test BOM, cdxgen can generate a keypair and sign in one
step:

```bash
cdxgen -o /absolute/path/to/bom.json --generate-key-and-sign /absolute/path/to/project
```

This is appropriate for testing signing workflows. It is not appropriate for
release signing, where the key should come from the user's key management.

## Sign

```bash
# Replace or create the root signature in place
cdx-sign -i /absolute/path/to/bom.json -k /absolute/path/to/builder_private.pem

# Write a signed copy to a new file, with an explicit algorithm
cdx-sign -i /absolute/path/to/bom.json -o /absolute/path/to/bom.signed.json \
  -k /absolute/path/to/builder_private.pem -a RS512
```

| Flag                  | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i, --input`         | BOM to sign                                                    |
| `-o, --output`        | Signed copy; omit to sign in place                             |
| `-k, --private-key`   | Private key, PEM format                                        |
| `-a, --algorithm`     | JSF algorithm; default `RS512`. Also `ES256`, `Ed25519`        |
| `-m, --mode`          | `replace` (default), `signers`, `chain`                        |
| `--key-id`            | Key identifier recorded in the signature                       |
| `--sign-components`   | Sign individual components                                     |
| `--sign-services`     | Sign individual services                                       |
| `--sign-annotations`  | Sign annotations                                               |
| `--attach`            | Attach the signature rather than replacing                     |

Defaults can come from `SBOM_SIGN_ALGORITHM` and `SBOM_SIGN_MODE`.

## Choosing a signature mode

| Mode      | Semantics                                                                  | Use for                                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replace` | Replaces or creates the root signature                                     | Build-time signing by the producer                        |
| `signers` | Appends a parallel signature without replacing existing ones               | Independent approvals from different teams                |
| `chain`   | Appends to a sequential signature history                                  | An ordered approval trail through pipeline stages         |

Append a security review signature without destroying the builder's:

```bash
cdx-sign -i /absolute/path/to/bom.json -k /absolute/path/to/auditor_private.pem \
  --mode signers --no-sign-components --no-sign-services --no-sign-annotations
```

Note the `--no-` prefixes: the reviewer signs the document, not every component,
which keeps the second signature cheap and its scope clear.

Build a chained history:

```bash
cdx-sign -i /absolute/path/to/bom.json -k /absolute/path/to/approver_private.pem --mode chain
```

Use `signers` when approvals are independent and order does not matter. Use
`chain` when the order is itself the evidence.

## Verify

```bash
cdx-verify -i /absolute/path/to/bom.json --public-key /absolute/path/to/public.pem
cdx-verify -i /absolute/path/to/bom.json --public-key /absolute/path/to/public.pem --deep
```

`--deep` verifies granular component, service, and annotation signatures rather
than only the document signature. Use it whenever the BOM was signed with
`--sign-components` or `--sign-services` — a passing shallow check on such a BOM
does not establish that the component signatures are intact.

`--platform` targets platform-specific verification behaviour.

## Verify structure and signature together

`cdx-validate` folds signature verification into full validation (JSON input
only):

```bash
cdx-validate -i /absolute/path/to/bom.json \
  --public-key /absolute/path/to/public.pem --require-signature
```

`--require-signature` makes an unsigned BOM a validation failure rather than a
silent pass. Prefer this in release gates. See `bom-convert-validate`.

## Reporting verification results

Be precise about what a result does and does not establish:

- A valid signature proves the BOM was signed by the holder of that key and has not been altered since. It says nothing about whether the BOM's contents are accurate.
- A shallow pass on a granularly signed BOM is not a full verification. Say when you did not run `--deep`.
- An unsigned BOM is not a failed signature. Distinguish "no signature present" from "signature invalid".
