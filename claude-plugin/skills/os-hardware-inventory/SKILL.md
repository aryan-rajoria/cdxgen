name: os-hardware-inventory
description: Collects live operating-system inventory (OBOM) and host hardware inventory (HBOM) as CycloneDX documents using the cdxgen obom and hbom commands, including osquery-backed runtime artifacts, Linux hardening snapshots, GTFOBins enrichment, firmware and bus topology, and macOS permission troubleshooting. Use when asked to inventory a live machine, audit a running host's packages or services, produce a hardware BOM, or check host trust posture.

# Live OS and hardware inventory

Two distinct documents, two distinct commands. Do not mix them.

| Want                              | Command                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Software on a running machine     | `obom` (`cdxgen -t os`)          |
| Physical hardware of the host     | `hbom`                           |
| Offline host from a mounted disk  | `-t rootfs` (see `container-sbom`) |

Read [reference/safety.md](../../reference/safety.md) first. Live host
collection reads far more of the machine than a project scan, so the
dry-run-and-confirm step matters more here, not less.

## The hard rule

Never combine `hbom` / `hardware` with software project types such as `js`,
`java`, `python`, `os`, or `oci` in one invocation. Generate them separately. If
the user wants one merged host document, use `hbom --include-runtime` rather
than stacking `-t` flags.

## OBOM: live operating-system inventory

```bash
obom -o /absolute/path/to/obom.json --deep
```

`obom` is an alias for `cdxgen -t os`. Aliases `osquery`, `windows`, `linux`,
`mac`, `macos`, `darwin` reach the same pipeline.

With a runtime audit:

```bash
obom -o /absolute/path/to/obom.json --deep \
  --bom-audit --bom-audit-categories obom-runtime
```

### What Linux OBOM adds

- osquery-derived runtime artifacts: processes, listening ports, users, services, scheduled jobs
- `sysctl_hardening` and `mount_hardening` snapshots
- GTFOBins enrichment on privileged and network-active runtime rows — a shell-escape-capable binary running privileged or listening on the network is the signal worth escalating

### macOS OBOM

Collection uses the bundled osquery binary in **shell mode**, which avoids the
older `/var/osquery` startup failure. Some tables still require Full Disk Access
or elevated privileges.

If tables come back empty or permission-gated, that is a host configuration
issue, not a cdxgen bug. Point the user at
<https://cdxgen.github.io/cdxgen/#/OBOM_MACOS_TROUBLESHOOTING> rather than
retrying the same command.

For live-host triage patterns generally, see
<https://cdxgen.github.io/cdxgen/#/OBOM_LESSONS>.

### OS trust inventory modelling

Understand the split before interpreting the output:

- **Repository sources** are ordinary `data` components.
- **Trusted keys and certificates** are `cryptographic-asset` components, and they **have no purls**. A missing purl here is correct, not a gap.

## HBOM: host hardware inventory

```bash
hbom -o /absolute/path/to/hbom.json
```

Hardware collection comes from the optional `@cdxgen/cdx-hbom` library, loaded
only when requested. Supported hosts:

- `darwin/arm64` (Apple Silicon macOS)
- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`

On an unsupported host, say so directly rather than producing an empty document
and calling it a success.

The equivalent library path is `cdxgen -t hbom .`, but prefer the dedicated
command.

### Merged hardware plus runtime host view

```bash
hbom --include-runtime -o /absolute/path/to/host-view.json
```

This is the supported way to get one document covering both. It also extends the
default audit categories to include `host-topology`.

### Diagnosing missing collectors

```bash
hbom diagnostics
```

Reports missing native utilities and permission-sensitive enrichments. Run this
first when an HBOM comes back sparse — the usual cause is an absent host
command, not a collection bug.

### Useful hbom flags

| Flag                      | Effect                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--include-runtime`       | Merge runtime host inventory into the hardware document    |
| `--privileged`            | Enable collectors that need elevated privileges           |
| `--sensitive`             | Include sensitive identifiers (ask the user first)        |
| `--plist-enrichment`      | macOS property-list enrichment                            |
| `--no-command-enrichment` | Skip host command invocation                               |
| `--timeout`               | Bound collector runtime                                    |
| `--export-proto`          | Protobuf output via `--proto-bin-file`                     |
| `--dry-run`               | Preview collection without writing                         |

Treat `--sensitive` as a confirm-first flag. It widens what lands in a document
the user may share.

### HBOM audit behaviour

For `hbom` / `hardware` targets, cdxgen **skips the predictive dependency audit
entirely** and defaults the audit categories to
`hbom-security,hbom-performance,hbom-compliance`. With `--include-runtime` it
adds `host-topology`.

```bash
hbom -o /absolute/path/to/hbom.json --bom-audit
cdx-audit --bom /absolute/path/to/hbom.json --direct-bom-audit --categories hbom
```

The `hbom` alias expands to the full HBOM review pack in one switch.

## Exploring the results

`cdxi` has dedicated commands for both document types (see `bom-explore`):

- OBOM: `.osinfocategories`, `.obomtips`, `.trusted`, `.instrumented`
- HBOM: `.hbomsummary`, `.hbomclasses`, `.hbomevidence`, `.hbomdiagnostics`, `.hbomfirmware`, `.hbombuses`, `.hbompower`, `.hbomtips`

Start with `.hbomsummary` or `.osinfocategories` before drilling into specifics.
