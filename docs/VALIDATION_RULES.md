# Validation rules

This document is the authoritative registry of every validation rule id
`cdx-validate` emits. Rule ids are a public API: once published, an id never
changes meaning, so CI pipelines can filter on these strings.

## Severity model

| Severity | Meaning | Exit code |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `error` | The BOM is not well-formed CycloneDX. | 3 (or 0 with `--fail-on none`) |
| `warning` | The BOM is well-formed but has a quality issue. Never fails by default. | 0 |
| `info` | Informational observation. Never fails. | 0 |

Warnings never cause a non-zero exit unless `--fail-on warning` is set;
`error` findings always produce exit code 3.

## Execution order

Schema validation runs first. When it produces any `error` finding the
semantic rules are skipped, so a structurally broken BOM reports the structural
problem rather than a cascade of consequences.

## Rule registry

### Schema rules

| Rule id | Severity | Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `schema.unsupported-version` | `error` | `specVersion` is not in the supported set (1.6, 1.7). |
| `schema.invalid` | `error` | The BOM does not conform to the CycloneDX JSON schema for its declared `specVersion`. |

### Metadata rules (`validateMetadata`)

All metadata checks produce `warning`; none can fail the BOM on their own.

| Rule id | Severity | Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `metadata.component-missing` | `warning` | `metadata.component` is absent or empty. |
| `metadata.component-purl-missing` | `warning` | `metadata.component` has no `purl`. |
| `metadata.component-bomref-missing` | `warning` | `metadata.component` has no `bom-ref`. |
| `metadata.component-version-missing` | `warning` | `metadata.component` has no `version`. |
| `metadata.component-placeholder-name` | `warning` | `metadata.component.name` is a placeholder (`app`, `application`, `project`). |
| `metadata.duplicate-parent-in-components` | `warning` | Parent component `bom-ref` appears inside `metadata.component.components`. |
| `metadata.duplicate-parent-by-name` | `warning` | Parent component `name` appears inside `metadata.component.components` when `bom-ref` is absent. |

### PURL rules (`validatePurls`)

| Rule id | Severity | Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `purl.crypto-asset-has-purl` | `error` | A `cryptographic-asset` component has a `purl` (spec forbids it). |
| `crypto.asset-missing-crypto-properties` | `error` | A `cryptographic-asset` component lacks `cryptoProperties`. |
| `crypto.algorithm-missing-oid` | `error` | A `cryptographic-asset` of `assetType: algorithm` has no `oid`. |
| `crypto.certificate-missing-algorithm-properties` | `error` | A `cryptographic-asset` of `assetType: certificate` has no `algorithmProperties`. |
| `purl.invalid-syntax` | `error` | The purl string cannot be parsed. |
| `purl.encoded-slash-without-namespace` | `error` | An `npm` or `golang` purl contains `%2F` in the name but has no namespace. |
| `purl.version-missing-epoch` | `error` | The component `version` does not start with the epoch qualifier value. |
| `purl.type-not-normalized` | `warning` | The purl type contains uppercase characters. |
| `purl.unexpected-qualifiers` | `warning` | Qualifiers are present on a purl type that does not use them per spec. |
| `purl.too-many-frameworks` | `warning` | More than 20 components are typed as `framework`. |

### Dependency / ref rules (`validateRefs`)

| Rule id | Severity | Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `ref.encoded-dependency-ref` | `error` | A dependency `ref` contains URL-encoded characters (`%40`, `%3A`, `%2F`). |
| `ref.partial-tree` | `warning` | The dependency tree has multiple empty `dependsOn` entries. |
| `ref.dangling-dependency-ref` | `warning` | A dependency `ref` does not correspond to any component `bom-ref`. |
| `ref.dangling-dependson-ref` | `warning` | A `dependsOn` entry does not correspond to any component `bom-ref`. |
| `ref.dangling-provides-ref` | `warning` | A `provides` entry does not correspond to any component `bom-ref`. |
| `ref.parent-without-children` | `warning` | The parent component's dependency entry has an empty `dependsOn` in a non-trivial tree. |
| `ref.type-mismatch` | `warning` | A parent and child in the dependency graph have different purl types (non-`oci`/`generic`/`container`). |

### Property / evidence rules (`validateProps`)

All property checks produce `warning`; none can fail the BOM. These checks only
run when `metadata.component.type` is `application`, `framework`, or `library`.
They are cdxgen quality checks, not CycloneDX spec violations.

| Rule id | Severity | Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `props.missing-properties` | `warning` | A library/framework npm or pypi component lacks `properties`. |
| `props.missing-srcfile` | `warning` | A component lacks a `SrcFile` property. |
| `props.missing-workspace-properties` | `warning` | In workspace mode, a component lacks workspace-related properties. |
| `props.missing-evidence` | `warning` | A component lacks `evidence`. |
| `props.npm-missing-tarball` | `warning` | Some npm components lack `externalReferences.distribution` while others have it. |
| `props.absolute-srcfile-path` | `warning` | A `SrcFile` property value starts with `/` (absolute path). |
| `props.suspicious-native-name` | `warning` | An npm package has a native-sounding name but no `cdx:npm:native_addon` flag. Not emitted; see below. |

## Not covered by these rules

- **Compliance benchmarks** (SCVS, CRA). Those answer "does this satisfy a
  policy?" rather than "is this well-formed CycloneDX?" and are selected with
  `--benchmark`.
- **SPDX export validation.** Converted SPDX documents are checked against the
  SPDX schema, not against this registry.
- **CycloneDX 1.4 and 1.5.** Below the v13 floor; both validators reject them
  identically.
- **Suspicious native package names.** Warning on any package named `native`
  or `bindings` produced false positives for ordinary projects, so no rule id
  is emitted for it.
